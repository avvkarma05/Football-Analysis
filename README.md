Football Analysis/ Tracking players and ball detection in Football:   

This Project uses YOLO for object detection and ByteTrack for tracking in football videos.
It detects players, referees, and the ball, assigning unique track IDs.
Tracked objects are visualized with ellipses for players and referees, and triangles for the ball.
It also supports saving and loading tracking data for efficient processing.
